# TODO

- fix tests:
  - ✅ schemaVersion from "experimental" to "0.1.0"
  - ✅ type.type -> type.text
  - ✅ parts -> cssParts
- ✅ fix types (I think I just have to yarn from the root again to link packages... but maybe release helpers first? to be sure?)
- mixins have parameters
  - remove superclass from mixins
  - add parameters to mixins
- make releases
