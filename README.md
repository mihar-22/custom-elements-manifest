# `@custom-elements-json`

> ⚠️ Very experimental and very unfinished

Custom-elements.json is a file format that describes custom elements. This format will allow tooling and IDEs to give rich information about the custom elements in a given project. It is, however, very experimental and things are subject to change. Follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-json).

This implementation is at a very early stage of development, and there will probably be bugs or things missing from the output `custom-elements.json`. You can help this project by trying it out in your project, and creating an issue if you find anything weird.
